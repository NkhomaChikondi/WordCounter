Daisy, on the other hand, was a gentle, doe-eyed deer with a coat the color of autumn leaves.
She roamed the forest with grace and curiosity, her large ears flicking at every sound, 
and her dark eyes taking in the world with a sense of wonder.

One crisp morning, as Sammy leaped from branch to branch,
he spotted Daisy grazing in a sun-dappled meadow. Intrigued by her elegant presence, 
Sammy decided to introduce himself. He hopped down from his tree and approached the young deer cautiously.
